The intention of this program is to generate random numbers and store a copy of them into two arrays
namely number[] and numbersCopy[].
Then apply an optimised version of mergeSort which contains the logic for insertion sort as well on the 
original array(numbers[]).
For the duplicated array (numbersCopy[]) we apply the normal mergeSort() algorithm.

We then compare the duration it takes for both algorithms to sort the same size of arrays and then we also 
measure the number of key comparisons that both of them make..
